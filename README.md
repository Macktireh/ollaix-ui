## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these steps to get Ollaix up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites ‚úÖ

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js:** (LTS version recommended)
- **npm** or **Yarn:** (npm comes with Node.js)

#### üì¶ Backend API Required

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> This frontend requires the [Ollaix API backend](https://github.com/Macktireh/ollaix) to function properly.
>
> Make sure the backend is running and accessible via the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable (default: `http://localhost:8000`).

The backend provides unified access to multiple AI models (including local models via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and cloud models like [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)) through a modern API built with [Litestar](https://litestar.dev/).

To learn more or get started with the backend, check out the [Ollaix API README](https://github.com/Macktireh/ollaix).

### Installation üíª

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Macktireh/ollaix-ui.git
    cd ollaix-ui
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying `.env.example`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Open `.env` and set the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend API endpoint. For local development, it will likely be:

    ```
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

> [!WARNING]
> This frontend requires a backend API to function. Ensure your backend is running and accessible at the specified `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is occupied).

### Installation with Docker üê≥

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    # Adjust the BASE_URL if your backend is not running on http://localhost:8000
    docker build --build-arg BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 -t ollaix-ui .
    ```

    This command builds the Docker image with the specified base URL for the API. Adjust the `BASE_URL` as needed for your environment (default is `http://localhost:8000`).

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name ollaix-ui ollaix-ui
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost`.
